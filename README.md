Lore (randomly chosen)
A wide-barreled multi launcher assembled by some cyberpunks for street wars against the concern. The blueprint quickly fell into the hand of some corporations, which ended up using the replika against their own inventors... on well-trained and paid security forces. The shells detonate on impact, leaving a small poison cloud behind known as the havoc. This heavy form of toxicity destroys biological organs in seconds. The name is kept until now.
